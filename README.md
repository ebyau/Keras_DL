# Keras_DL

This repository contains code implementation for keras deeplearning framework.
The frmawork is built on top of either tensorflow or theano as backend, but for this case i 
used the tensorflow.
# what is Contained
 It starts outs with basic deep learning tasks using neural nets and goes on to explore using 
 CNN to achieve higher accuracy and better generalization. 
 The code implementations are inspired form Adrian Roosebrock's DL4CV starter bundle book.
